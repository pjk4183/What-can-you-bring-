## Inspiration
While doing the security checks and screening at the airport, have U ever worried that what you brought might have put you in trouble? Not every people do perfectly recognize tons of restricted or prohibited items. Our team created a mobile application to allow users to get rid of their concerns and worries about the security checks at the airport.

## What it does
‘What can U bring’ is a perfect mobile application for especially those who have experienced in the inspection of their baggage. Our app is a chatbot mobile application so that users can easily search which item is acceptable instead of searching online and scrolling down the thousands of prohibited item list. Furthermore, our app has an object recognition system with machine learning, so users can search the prohibited items by taking a picture.

## How we built it
Since our team is a group of two, one person took charged of the frontend, developing and designing a mobile application and building a server between Flutter and Python. Another person worked on the backend, developing an image recognition algorithm with TensorFlow. All the data is from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Transportation website and the data was collected by using API and Automatic Web Crawling methods.
